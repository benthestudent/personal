						<h3>BLab</h3>
						<p>Used in my high school's production of <i>The Little Mermaid</i> and other theater performances, this software helps simplify the sound effect and music organization, ordering and playing process. A user-friendly, programmed in Java soundboard, Blab was my Windows-compatible equivalent to the soundboard functions of the popular program QLab and, thus, possesses the essential functionality to help in the audio playing aspects of various theater productions.</p>

						<h3><a href="https://diyhub.io/" target="_blank">diyhub.io</a></h3>
						<p>Made in collaboration with front-end developer, Elijah Lopez, our project diyhub.io serves as a search engine for DIY projects and allows users to find projects that require only the parts and supplies they have on hand. Users can select the parts they already own from a list of supplies, and our website, with its Django back-end, filters through our database of projects and displays all the various creations the given user can build. Users can also upload and publish their own DIY project tutorials for others to find and create.</p>

						<h3>Raspberry Pi Thermal Camera</h3>
						<p>Based on <a href="https://nalbam.github.io/2020/02/28/body-temperature-alarm-en.html" target="_blank">this project</a>, this Raspberry pi-based camera and temperature reader utilizes a thermal camera and a database of faces to recognize people as they enter a building, read their temperature and send alerts through Slack if they show signs of fever or sickness. Using AWS Lambda, S3 and Rekognition, this python program effectively utilizes machine learning and sensory input to provide extra security against the COVID-19 virus by detecting potentially infected people.</p>

				<div class="project-content right">
					<p>Since the age of ten, I have dreamed of being an experienced engineer bringing countless ideas to fruition with my extensive programming knowledge. At a young age, I plugged myself into the world of electronics, researching programming languages, reading books on the subject, nodding through convoluted conversations with my electrical engineer uncle, and learning the fundamentals of computer science; but my cravings for knowledge remain unsatisfied. Over the last few years, I have taught myself various skills from web development to Object-Oriented Python programming through experimentation and freelance work. In addition to learning at home, I have attended multiple computer science and programming classes, including one taught entirely in German. I traveled to Germany as a foreign exchange student in my junior year of high school; there, I lived with a host family and attended a German high school for roughly ten months. Now, I speak fluent German and conversational Spanish, which I am currently learning to pursue my other interests in culture and language. My work as a freelance developer has revealed to me my passion for learning new skills and finding creative solutions to problems with computer science, a passion I am determined to pursue further to satisfy my desire for knowledge.</p>

				<div class="project-content right">
					<p>Developed for Gymnify, a 24-hour family oriented gym located in Alabama, this device utilizes a Raspberry Pi to automate the client check-in process. The scanner allows clients to scan their membership cards, which it then uses to verify that the client is a paid-member. If the client has a valid membership, it opens an electric lock, allowing them access to the gym. The scanner will also display a message to the client, which can be customized by the gym owner. In addition to running 24/7, these systems download and constantly update a local version of the user database to ensure continued functionality in case of internet connectivity problems. In service now for roughly three years, these devices have scanned over 180,000 QR/Barcodes and are still in use today.

					<p>I helped develop this website and app at my first ever hackathon, the Atoms and Bits Hackathon at Make School in San Francisco. Inspired by my participation in school strikes against climate change, I wanted to create a simple website and app that would allow anyone to help reverse the destructive effects of global warming by replanting trees around the world. By repeatedly clicking a button or answering trivia questions on the website and app, users would water a virtual tree and thereby interact with ads which generate revenue to be donated to tree-planting nonprofits across the globe. With simplicity and efficiency in mind, this service is meant to enable anyone and everyone to contribute to the efforts against climate change by combating deforestation, which is responsible for cutting down over 15 billion trees a year. Because of its potential to help our society, Replant Earth (originally Treology) won my team the Make School Social Impact award at the hackathon.</p>

					<p>Inspired by my desire to build DIY projects and inability to find projects I could build with what I had, I teamed up with talented front-end developer and close friend Elijah Lopez to create diyhub.io. Sourcing projects from various DIY websites and our own users, diyhub.io uses a database of projects and parts to allow users to find, filter through and discover projects they can build with what they have. Moreover, anyone can upload and publish their own DIY tutorials to the site for others to discover and create. Using Django, PostgreSQL, AWS Lightsail, Apache, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, diyhub.io represents Elijah's and my own collective ability to work together to produce a well-designed, fully functional, responsive and interactive website, adminster its server and market it to users.</p>
