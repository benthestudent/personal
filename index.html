					<p>Since the age of ten, I have dreamed of being an experienced engineer bringing countless ideas to fruition with my extensive programming knowledge. At a young age, I plugged myself into the world of electronics, researching programming languages, reading books on the subject, nodding through convoluted conversations with my electrical engineer uncle, and learning the fundamentals of computer science; but my cravings for knowledge remain unsatisfied. Over the last few years, I have taught myself various skills from web development to Object-Oriented Python programming through experimentation and freelance work. In addition to learning at home, I have attended multiple computer science and programming classes, including one taught entirely in German. I traveled to Germany as a foreign exchange student in my junior year of high school; there, I lived with a host family and attended a German high school for roughly ten months. Now, I speak fluent German and conversational Spanish, which I am currently learning to pursue my other interests in culture and language. My work as a freelance developer has revealed to me my passion for learning new skills and finding creative solutions to problems with computer science, a passion I am determined to pursue further to satisfy my desire for knowledge.</p>

					<p>Developed for Gymnify, a 24-hour family oriented gym located in Alabama, this device utilizes a Raspberry Pi to automate the client check-in process. The scanner allows clients to scan their membership cards, which it then uses to verify that the client is a paid-member. If the client has a valid membership, it opens an electric lock, allowing them access to the gym. The scanner will also display a message to the client, which can be customized by the gym owner. In addition to running 24/7, these systems download and constantly update a local version of the user database to ensure continued functionality in case of internet connectivity problems. In service now for roughly three years, these devices have scanned over 180,000 QR/Barcodes and are still in use today.

					<p>I helped develop this website and app at my first ever hackathon, the Atoms and Bits Hackathon at Make School in San Francisco. Inspired by my participation in school strikes against climate change, I wanted to create a simple website and app that would allow anyone to help reverse the destructive effects of global warming by replanting trees around the world. By repeatedly clicking a button or answering trivia questions on the website and app, users would water a virtual tree and thereby interact with ads which generate revenue to be donated to tree-planting nonprofits across the globe. With simplicity and efficiency in mind, this service is meant to enable anyone and everyone to contribute to the efforts against climate change by combating deforestation, which is responsible for cutting down over 15 billion trees a year. Because of its potential to help our society, Replant Earth (originally Treology) won my team the Make School Social Impact award at the hackathon.</p>

					<p>Web development was my introduction to the world of computer science and electronics. Beginning with HTML, CSS, JS and PHP, I have learned basic web development and have since continued experimenting with different frameworks such as NodeJS and Django. Developed in a little over a day, this website, purposefully simple, fulfills its purpose of displaying my portfolio while demonstrating my web development skills.</p>
